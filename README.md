### SimpleCalculator

This project creates a simple calculator application that asks a user to enter two
numbers and the operation (e.g. +, -, x, etc.) that theyâ€™d like to perform on
the numbers. It then displays the answer to the equation. Every equation entered
by the user is written to a text file.

It is then extended to give the user the option to either enter two
numbers and an operator, like before, or to read all of the equations from a
new txt file (the user should add the name of the text file as an input) and
print out all of the equations together with the results. Defensive
coding is used to ensure that the program does not crash if the file does not exist
and that the user is prompted again to enter the name of the file.
